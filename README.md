Title: Arduino-Based Milk Quality Testing System

Introduction:
In dairy industries, ensuring milk quality is crucial for maintaining consumer trust and adhering to regulatory standards. This Arduino-based milk quality testing system offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for monitoring various parameters such as pH, methane, temperature, and lactometer readings.

Components Required:

Arduino microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
pH sensor
Methane sensor
Temperature sensor (e.g., DS18B20)
Lactometer
LCD display
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power source (e.g., battery or power adapter)
Circuit Design:

Connect the pH sensor, methane sensor, temperature sensor, and lactometer to the Arduino Uno according to their respective datasheets.
Connect the LCD display to the Arduino for real-time parameter display.
Ensure proper power connections and ground connections.
